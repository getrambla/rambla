# CLI reference

The Rambla CLI lets you manage agents from your terminal. It's the same interface exposed by the daemon's API, so anything you can do in the app you can do from the command line.

> **Agent orchestration:** You can tell coding agents to use the Rambla CLI to spawn and manage other agents. Rambla recognizes the calling agent, so CLI-created workers get the same workspace and parent defaults as MCP-created workers.

## Quick reference

```bash
rambla run "fix the tests"            # Start an agent
rambla ls                             # List running agents
rambla attach <id>                    # Stream agent output
rambla send <id> "also fix linting"   # Send follow-up task
rambla logs <id>                      # View agent timeline
rambla stop <id>                      # Stop an agent
```

## Provider diagnostics

Ask the daemon to inspect the provider environment it actually uses:

```bash
rambla provider diagnostic claude
rambla provider diagnostic codex --json
rambla --host devbox:6767 provider diagnostic opencode
```

The diagnostic includes the configured command, daemon `PATH` and shell, matching binaries, resolved path, version, model count, and provider status. Use the global `--host` option for a remote daemon. This is the same diagnostic shown under **Settings → your host → Providers → provider → Diagnostic**.

## Running agents

Use `rambla run` to start a new agent with a task:

```bash
rambla run "implement user authentication"
rambla run --provider codex "refactor the API layer"
rambla run --background "run the focused test suite"
rambla run --new-workspace worktree --worktree-mode branch-off --new-branch feature/x --base origin/main "implement feature X"
rambla run --workspace <workspace-id> "review the current diff"
rambla run --output-schema schema.json "extract release notes"
rambla run --output-schema '{"type":"object","properties":{"summary":{"type":"string"}},"required":["summary"]}' "summarize release notes"
```

From a human shell, a bare `rambla run` creates a new local workspace for the current directory. Use `--workspace <id>` to add the agent to an existing workspace, or `--new-workspace local|worktree` to explicitly create a separate workspace for the run.

Worktree creation accepts `--worktree-mode branch-off|checkout-branch|checkout-pr` plus the matching `--new-branch`/`--base`, `--branch`, or `--pr-number`/`--forge` options. Use `--worktree-slug` to choose the managed directory slug.

When an existing Rambla agent runs the same command, Rambla recognizes it through `RAMBLA_AGENT_ID`. Without explicit placement, the new agent becomes its subagent in the same workspace. `--workspace` can place that subagent elsewhere without changing its parent.

Use `--output-schema` to return only matching JSON output. You can pass a schema file path or an inline JSON schema object. This mode cannot be used with `--background`.

By default, `rambla run` waits for completion. Use `--background` to return immediately while the agent keeps running.

## Projects

Register the current directory as a project, then list the projects known to the daemon:

```bash
cd ~/dev/my-app
rambla project create
rambla project ls
```

Use the project ID from `rambla project ls` to rename, reset, or delete a project:

```bash
rambla project rename <project-id> "My app"
rambla project rename <project-id> --reset
rambla project delete <project-id>
```

`--reset` restores the name derived from the project directory. Deleting a project archives its active workspaces and removes the project from Rambla. It does not delete the project directory.

For a local daemon, `rambla project create [path]` defaults to the current directory and resolves relative paths on the CLI machine. When you use the global `--host` option or `RAMBLA_HOST`, provide a path that the target daemon can access:

```bash
rambla --host devbox:6767 project create /srv/repos/api
```

The remote daemon interprets that path on its own machine. See [Workspaces](/docs/workspaces) for how projects group working directories and sessions.

## Workspaces

Create a workspace independently when you want to prepare its files before starting an agent:

```bash
rambla workspace create --isolation local --path ~/dev/my-app --title main

rambla workspace create \
  --isolation worktree \
  --path ~/dev/my-app \
  --mode branch-off \
  --new-branch feature/auth \
  --worktree-slug feature-auth \
  --base origin/main

rambla workspace create \
  --isolation worktree \
  --path ~/dev/my-app \
  --mode checkout-branch \
  --branch feature/existing \
  --worktree-slug existing-copy

rambla workspace create \
  --isolation worktree \
  --path ~/dev/my-app \
  --mode checkout-pr \
  --pr-number 2186
```

Then list, use, rename, or archive it:

```bash
rambla workspace ls
rambla run --workspace <workspace-id> "implement authentication"
rambla workspace rename <workspace-id> "Auth rework"
rambla workspace rename <workspace-id> --reset   # back to the branch or directory name
rambla workspace archive <workspace-id>
```

Add `--forge <name>` to PR checkout when Rambla cannot infer the forge from the source checkout. See [Git worktrees](/docs/worktrees) for setup hooks and services.

## Terminals

Use the workspace ID when multiple workspaces share a directory:

```bash
rambla terminal create --workspace <workspace-id> --name Development
rambla terminal ls --workspace <workspace-id> --json
rambla terminal send-keys <terminal-id> -l "echo ready"
rambla terminal send-keys <terminal-id> Enter
rambla terminal capture <terminal-id>
rambla terminal kill <terminal-id>
```

Creation defaults to the workspace directory. Add `--cwd <absolute-path>` to change the process directory while keeping that workspace as the owner. Unknown and archived workspace IDs fail.

Without `--workspace`, creation opens the project at `--cwd` or the current directory and reuses its oldest active workspace. Listing without `--workspace` filters by `--cwd` or the current directory and can include multiple workspaces. `ls --all` lists every terminal on the host and cannot be combined with directory or workspace filters.

Create and list results include `id`, `name`, `cwd`, and `workspaceId`. Use `--json` for structured output and the global `--host` option to target another daemon. These commands require a host that supports the [workspace terminal API](/docs/sdk/reference#clientterminals); older hosts return an update message.

## Workspace scripts

List, start, and stop the scripts configured in a workspace's `rambla.json`:

```bash
rambla script ls
rambla script start web
rambla script stop web
```

By default, Rambla selects the workspace whose directory is the current directory. Pass `--cwd <path>` to select a different directory, or `--workspace <workspace-id>` when a directory has multiple workspaces. Use the global `--host` option to target another daemon. These commands also accept standard output options such as `--json`.

The output includes each script's lifecycle and supervised terminal ID. Services also include their assigned port, proxy URL, and health. See [Git worktrees](/docs/worktrees#scripts-and-services) for `rambla.json` configuration.

## Plugins

> **Trust every plugin you add.** `rambla plugin add` and `rambla plugin install` mean “I trust this codebase.” Plugin server code and Git preparation commands run unsandboxed with the daemon user's access on the daemon host; client contributions run inside Rambla. Dependencies and future updates are part of that decision. With the global `--host` option, commands run on the remote daemon host.

Create and manage trusted plugins on a daemon:

```bash
rambla plugin init /absolute/path/to/plugin
rambla plugin install /absolute/path/to/plugin
rambla plugin add owner/repository
rambla plugin add https://gitlab.com/group/repository.git --ref main
rambla plugin add owner/monorepo:plugins/review
rambla plugin ls [id]
rambla plugin update my-plugin
rambla plugin update --all
rambla plugin reload my-plugin
rambla plugin logs my-plugin
rambla plugin disable my-plugin
rambla plugin enable my-plugin
rambla plugin remove my-plugin
```

GitHub shorthand checks an existing host directory first. Append `:<directory>` for a plugin in a
monorepo. `rambla plugin ls [id]` does not contact the remote. `rambla plugin logs <id>` returns the
plugin's recent daemon-side stdout and stderr. Add `--json` for structured entries, or run
`rambla --host <target> plugin logs <id>` for another daemon. See the
[Plugin reference](/docs/plugins/v0.7/reference) for installation, trust, lifecycle, and log-retention
behavior.

## Listing agents

```bash
rambla ls                    # Non-archived agents in active workspaces
rambla ls -a                 # Also include archived agents
rambla ls -g                 # Non-archived agents across all workspaces
rambla ls -a -g --json       # All agents, including archived, as JSON
```

## Streaming output

Use `rambla attach` to stream an agent's output in real-time:

```bash
rambla attach abc123   # Attach to agent (Ctrl+C to detach)
```

Agent IDs can be shortened, `abc` works if it's unambiguous.

## Sending messages

Send follow-up tasks to a running or idle agent:

Use the recipient's agent ID from `rambla ls`, or [copy it from the agent's tab](/docs/orchestration-workflows#send-a-prompt-to-another-agent).

```bash
rambla send <id> "now run the tests"
rambla send <id> --image screenshot.png "what's wrong here?"
rambla send <id> --no-wait "queue this task"
```

## Viewing logs

```bash
rambla logs <id>                  # Full timeline
rambla logs <id> -f               # Follow (streaming)
rambla logs <id> --tail 10        # Last 10 entries
rambla logs <id> --filter tools   # Only tool calls
```

## Waiting for agents

Block until an agent finishes its current task:

```bash
rambla wait <id>
rambla wait <id> --timeout 60   # 60 second timeout
```

Useful in scripts or when one agent needs to wait for another.

## Schedules

Run an agent on a cron schedule. The CLI also accepts simple cadence presets and compiles them to cron. See [Schedules from the CLI](/docs/schedules-cli) for the full reference.

```bash
rambla schedule create --every 30m --cwd ~/dev/my-app "Continue the refactor and leave a note."
rambla schedule ls
rambla schedule pause <id>
```

## Permissions

Agents may request permission for certain actions. Manage these from the CLI:

```bash
rambla permit ls                # List pending requests
rambla permit allow <id>        # Allow all pending for agent
rambla permit deny <id> --all   # Deny all pending
```

## Agent modes

Change an agent's operational mode (provider-specific):

```bash
rambla agent mode <id> --list   # Show available modes
rambla agent mode <id> bypass   # Set bypass mode
rambla agent mode <id> plan     # Set plan mode
rambla agent detach <id>        # Make a subagent top-level
```

Detaching is an explicit lifecycle action, not a creation flag. The agent keeps running; only its relationship to its parent changes.

## Daemon management

```bash
rambla daemon start             # Start the daemon
rambla daemon start --web-ui    # Start and serve the bundled web UI
rambla daemon status            # Check status
rambla reload                    # Reload config.json (top-level alias)
rambla daemon reload             # Reload config.json
rambla daemon stop              # Stop the daemon
```

Reload validates the whole file, applies runtime-safe changes, and reports `appliedPaths`, `restartRequiredPaths`, and `overrideControlledPaths`. Human output prints `rambla daemon restart` only when a changed setting needs it. Use `--json` or `--format yaml` for the structured result. Run `rambla --host <target> reload` to reload a remote daemon's own configuration file. An older host that does not support reload returns an update-host error.

Use `RAMBLA_HOME` to run multiple isolated daemon instances.

## Hub

```bash
rambla hub login [url]          # Approve and store organization-scoped CLI access
rambla hub init                 # Create and optionally deploy a starter trigger here
rambla hub connect [url]        # Enroll this daemon using CLI access
rambla hub projects             # List legacy projects in the authenticated organization
rambla hub status               # Show the current Hub relationship
rambla hub disconnect           # End it
rambla hub deploy               # Validate and install .rambla/triggers/*.yml
rambla hub deploy --dry-run     # Validate without installing
rambla hub deploy -p <project>   # Deploy an existing legacy project bundle
rambla hub logout               # Remove the active stored CLI login
```

Run deploy from the repository root. By default it reads every direct `.rambla/triggers/*.yml` file in deterministic path order. It validates all triggers before installing them one at a time. If an installation fails after earlier ones succeeded, the error lists the installed files. `--dry-run` only validates; it does not create or activate revisions.

Pass `-p, --project <slug>` for an existing legacy bundle: `.rambla/hub.yml`, direct `.rambla/workflows/*.yml` files, and referenced workflow partials. See [Deploy from the CLI](/docs/hub/configuration#deploy-from-the-cli).

`login` opens the Hub approval page and stores a durable organization-scoped CLI credential under `RAMBLA_HOME`. In an interactive terminal it offers to connect this daemon, then separately asks whether to allow Hub automations to run agents. Connection defaults to yes; execution permission defaults to no. It then links to Hub's **Triggers** page and prints `rambla hub init` for setup as code. `--json` and non-TTY login remain login-only and never prompt. The stored login is separate from the daemon relationship created by `connect`.

`init` requires a TTY. It signs in and connects the daemon as needed, then lists the organization's app connections that can back a starter trigger. One usable connection is selected automatically; with several, you choose a **Trigger connection**. If none is ready, setup sends you to **Hub → Apps** and stops before selecting an agent or writing files.

Setup asks which agent provider, model, and mode to run. Providers must be enabled and expose both a selectable model and an execution mode. Suggested model and mode entries are the daemon's defaults; a mode is still selected explicitly when there is no default. Setup then asks for the identity allowed to trigger the bot: a GitHub username, Slack member ID, or Discord user ID. It validates the trigger, writes `.rambla/triggers/<provider>-help.yml`, and asks whether to deploy. Replacing that file requires confirmation; existing legacy bundles and other trigger files are preserved. See the [generated starter trigger](/docs/hub/configuration#generated-starter-trigger).

Interactive logout checks the same-origin daemon relationship and asks whether to disconnect before deleting the login. Declining removes only the login. JSON and noninteractive logout never prompt or disconnect implicitly; `--disconnect-daemon` is the explicit automation path, and `--force` applies to that daemon disconnection. If a requested disconnection fails, the login is preserved.

Every command resolves and normalizes its destination before Hub or daemon work. Origin precedence is an explicit command origin or `--hub`, then `RAMBLA_HUB_URL`, then the active stored login origin, then the hosted default `https://hub.rambla.sh`. The hosted default never overrides an active login. Credential precedence is `--api-key <secret>`, then `RAMBLA_HUB_API_KEY`, then a stored login for the exact resolved origin. A stored credential is never sent to a different origin. API keys passed through flags or the environment are not stored.

Human output reports the resolved destination before each action. JSON output keeps stdout machine-readable and includes the normalized Hub origin. Bundle diagnostics identify paths without printing configuration contents or credentials.

See [Daemons in Hub](/docs/hub/daemons), [Hub configuration](/docs/hub/configuration), and the [Hub public API](/docs/hub/api).

## Connecting to a remote daemon

The global `--host` option accepts either a local target (`host:port`, a unix socket, or a Windows pipe) or a pairing offer URL, the same `https://app.rambla.sh/#offer=...` link the mobile app uses for QR pairing. With an offer URL the CLI connects through the Rambla relay with end-to-end encryption, so you can drive a daemon on another machine without exposing it to the network.

Get an offer URL from the daemon you want to control:

```bash
rambla daemon pair          # asks before enabling relay, then prints the QR and link
rambla daemon pair --relay  # enables relay without prompting
rambla daemon pair --json   # structured output; never prompts
```

Relay is off for new installations. In non-interactive or JSON mode, a disabled relay returns a `RELAY_DISABLED` error; pass `--relay` to provide explicit consent. Relay pairing is end-to-end encrypted. See [Security](/docs/security).

Use it from anywhere:

```bash
rambla --host 'https://app.rambla.sh/#offer=eyJ2IjoyLC...' ls
rambla --host "$OFFER_URL" run "fix the failing tests"
```

You can also set it once via `RAMBLA_HOST` instead of passing `--host` on every command. An explicit flag overrides the environment variable.

## Multi-agent workflows

The CLI is designed to be used by agents themselves. You can instruct an agent to spawn sub-agents for parallel work:

```bash
# Agent A spawns Agent B and waits for it
agent_id=$(rambla run --background --quiet --title api-agent "implement the API")
rambla wait "$agent_id"
rambla logs "$agent_id" --tail 5
```

Because Agent A's ID is present in the environment, Agent B is created as its subagent in the same workspace unless `--workspace` is specified.

Simple implement + verify loop:

```bash
# Requires jq
while true; do
  rambla run --provider codex "make the tests pass" >/dev/null

  verdict=$(rambla run --provider claude --output-schema '{"type":"object","properties":{"criteria_met":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["criteria_met"],"additionalProperties":false}' "ensure tests all pass")
  if echo "$verdict" | jq -e '.criteria_met == true' >/dev/null; then
    echo "criteria met"
    break
  fi
done
```

This pattern enables hierarchical task decomposition, a lead agent can break down work, delegate to specialists, and synthesize results.

## Output formats

Most commands support multiple output formats for scripting:

```bash
rambla ls --json                # JSON output
rambla ls --format yaml         # YAML output
rambla ls -q                    # IDs only (quiet)
```

## Global options

- `--host <target>`, connect to a different daemon (`host:port`, unix socket, or `https://app.rambla.sh/#offer=...` for relay). See [Connecting to a remote daemon](#connecting-to-a-remote-daemon).
- `--json`, JSON output
- `-q, --quiet`, minimal output
- `--no-color`, disable colors
