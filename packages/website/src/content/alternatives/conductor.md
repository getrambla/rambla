# Rambla vs Conductor

Conductor is a proprietary macOS app for running Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode in parallel Git worktrees and managed cloud workspaces.

Rambla is an app for orchestrating coding agents, with native clients on desktop, mobile, web, and the CLI. Open source (Apache-2.0).

## The main difference

Conductor provides free local workspaces on macOS. Its managed cloud workspaces, API, collaboration features, and forthcoming mobile app are included in the $50 per month Pro plan.

Conductor raised a $22 million Series A and is proprietary. Rambla is independent, Apache 2.0 licensed, available on macOS, Linux, Windows, iOS, and Android, and can connect to machines you control.

## Architecture

The Rambla daemon runs as its own process. Desktop, web, mobile, and CLI all connect to it over a websocket. Run the daemon on your laptop, on a VM, in Docker, or across a fleet, and connect to any of them from any client.

Conductor runs local workspaces through its macOS app and cloud workspaces in managed Vercel sandboxes. It does not currently support connecting its clients to a cloud machine you operate.

## Providers

Rambla runs Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Pi natively, plus 30+ more agents through the in-app catalog including GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and Amp. Rambla speaks the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com), so any ACP agent works. Custom providers run any CLI agent. See [all supported providers](/agents).

Conductor supports Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode.

Both tools use your provider credentials. Rambla launches the provider installed on your machine. Conductor bundles managed Claude Code and Codex binaries and provides managed integrations for Cursor and OpenCode.

## Application plugins

[Rambla plugins](/docs/plugins) extend Rambla itself. They can add server behavior and native client components such as workspace panels, sidebar items, composer attachments, themes, and Command Center items across desktop, browser, iOS, and Android.

Conductor does not document an application extension API for adding both server behavior and native client components.

## Panes

Rambla's app has split panes and tabs (⌘D for vertical, ⌘⇧D for horizontal). Panes include a terminal alongside your agents, a diff viewer, and a browser for testing running services.

## GitHub

Rambla's app handles commit, push, opening PRs, watching checks and reviews, and merging.

## CLI

Rambla has a CLI that mirrors the app:

```bash
rambla run --provider codex "implement OAuth"
rambla run --host devbox:6767 "run the test suite"
rambla ls
rambla send <agent-id> "add tests"
rambla schedule create --cron "0 9 * * 1" "audit the codebase"
```

`rambla run --host` connects to a remote daemon. `rambla schedule` runs an agent on a cron.

Conductor lists its API as a Pro feature but does not document a user-facing CLI comparable to Rambla's.

## Worktrees and services

Both tools isolate parallel agents in git worktrees.

Rambla also gives each worktree its own dev server URL. Two agents running their dev servers at the same time get `web.fix-auth.my-app.localhost` and `web.add-search.my-app.localhost` instead of port collisions.

## Mobile

Rambla ships native iOS and Android apps today. Conductor lists its mobile app as coming soon under the Pro plan.

## Voice

Rambla supports local speech-to-text and text-to-speech. Conductor does not currently document a voice interface.
