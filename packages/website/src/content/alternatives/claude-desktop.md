# Rambla vs Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop is Anthropic's app for Claude Chat, Cowork, and Claude Code on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

Rambla is an app for orchestrating coding agents, with native clients on desktop, mobile, web, and the CLI. Open source (Apache-2.0).

## The main difference

Claude Desktop is Anthropic's first-party interface for Claude and requires a Claude account. It can run Claude Code locally, over SSH, or on Anthropic's infrastructure.

Rambla is an open source control plane that runs on machines you control. It does not require a Rambla account, collect telemetry, or depend on a Rambla cloud service. Connect directly from desktop, mobile, web, or the CLI, or use the optional end-to-end encrypted relay when the daemon is behind a firewall.

Rambla does not upload or store your code. The relay cannot read your code, messages, or agent output. You can also self-host the daemon, web client, and relay.

## Architecture

Rambla runs an independent daemon on your laptop, workstation, VM, home lab, or cloud machine. Its clients connect directly or through the optional end-to-end encrypted relay. The daemon launches your installed providers with their existing credentials, skills, MCP servers, and project configuration.

Claude Desktop is the Anthropic-controlled host application. Claude Code can run locally, connect over SSH, or use Anthropic-managed cloud sessions.

## Providers

Claude Desktop runs Claude Code.

Rambla runs Claude Code too, plus Codex, OpenCode, Pi, Antigravity, and Muse Code natively, plus 30+ more agents through the in-app catalog including GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and Amp. Rambla speaks the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com), so any ACP agent works. Custom providers run any CLI agent. See [all supported providers](/agents).

## Application plugins

[Rambla plugins](/docs/plugins) extend Rambla itself. They can add server behavior and native client components such as workspace panels, sidebar items, composer attachments, themes, and Command Center items across desktop, browser, iOS, and Android.

Claude Desktop does not document an application extension API for adding both server behavior and native client components.

## Desktop platforms

Both Claude Desktop and Rambla are available on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Mobile

The mobile app is the full app, native on iOS and Android, with full feature parity with desktop.

Claude has iOS and Android apps. Dispatch can start local Claude Code work through an active Claude Desktop host or start a cloud session on Anthropic's infrastructure.

## Panes

Both tools support visual coding workflows around Claude Code.

Rambla's app has split panes and tabs (⌘D for vertical, ⌘⇧D for horizontal). Panes include agents, terminals, a diff viewer, and a browser for testing running services.

Claude Desktop has a graphical Code tab with sessions, integrated terminal, file editor, visual diff review, live app preview, PR monitoring, and scheduled tasks.

## GitHub

Rambla's app handles commit, push, opening PRs, watching checks and reviews, and merging.

Claude Desktop can monitor pull request status and can fix failures or merge when checks pass, depending on the workflow and permissions.

## CLI and automation

Claude Code has its own CLI, IDE integrations, web surface, scheduled tasks, and cloud sessions.

Rambla's CLI controls the same daemon as the app:

```bash
rambla run --provider claude "implement OAuth"
rambla run --provider codex --worktree refactor-auth "refactor auth"
rambla run --host devbox:6767 "run the test suite"
rambla ls
rambla send <agent-id> "add tests"
rambla schedule create --cron "0 9 * * 1" "audit the codebase"
```

`rambla run --host` connects to a remote daemon. `rambla schedule` runs an agent on a cron. The MCP server lets other agents create worktrees, launch agents, open terminals, and send prompts.

## Worktrees and services

Both tools support parallel coding sessions, including Git worktrees.

Rambla also gives each worktree its own dev server URL. Two agents running their dev servers at the same time get `web--fix-auth--my-app.localhost` and `web--add-search--my-app.localhost` instead of port collisions.

## Voice

Rambla supports dictation and realtime voice mode. Speech-to-text and text-to-speech can run locally on your device.

Claude supports voice in Claude's own mobile and app surfaces. Claude Code itself is available in Claude Desktop, terminal, IDE, web, and mobile Remote Control workflows.
