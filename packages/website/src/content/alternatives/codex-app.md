# Rambla vs Codex App

OpenAI provides Codex through the ChatGPT desktop app on macOS, Windows, and Linux, with local, worktree, cloud, and remote workflows.

Rambla is an app for orchestrating coding agents, with native clients on desktop, mobile, web, and the CLI. Open source (Apache-2.0).

## The main difference

OpenAI provides Codex through the ChatGPT desktop and mobile apps. Using those product surfaces requires an OpenAI account, and cloud work runs on OpenAI-managed infrastructure.

Rambla runs your installed Codex CLI on machines you control. It does not require a Rambla account, collect telemetry, or depend on a Rambla cloud service. Connect directly from desktop, mobile, web, or the CLI, or use the optional end-to-end encrypted relay.

Rambla does not upload or store your code. The relay cannot read your code, messages, or agent output. You can self-host the daemon, web client, and relay, and use the same control plane with Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Pi, ACP agents, and custom providers.

## Architecture

Rambla runs an independent daemon on your laptop, workstation, VM, home lab, or cloud machine. The daemon launches your installed Codex CLI with its existing credentials and configuration. Clients connect directly or through the optional end-to-end encrypted relay.

OpenAI provides local, worktree, remote, and cloud Codex workflows through its ChatGPT product surfaces. Local and remote work use a connected host, while cloud work runs on OpenAI-managed infrastructure.

## Providers

Codex App runs Codex.

Rambla runs Codex too, plus Claude Code, OpenCode, and Pi natively, plus 30+ more agents through the in-app catalog including GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and Amp. Rambla speaks the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com), so any ACP agent works. Custom providers run any CLI agent. See [all supported providers](/agents).

## Application plugins

[Rambla plugins](/docs/plugins) extend Rambla itself. They can add server behavior and native client components such as workspace panels, sidebar items, composer attachments, themes, and Command Center items across desktop, browser, iOS, and Android.

Codex supports skills, MCP servers, and other agent extensions. OpenAI does not document an extension API for adding server-side behavior and native interface components to the Codex application itself.

## Desktop platforms

OpenAI's desktop app and Rambla are available on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Mobile

Rambla ships native iOS and Android apps with the same agent workflow as the desktop app.

ChatGPT Remote can start and continue Codex chats, approve actions, and review outputs from iOS and Android through a connected desktop host.

## Worktrees and local setup

Both tools support Git worktrees for parallel work.

Codex App creates Codex-managed worktrees under `$CODEX_HOME/worktrees` and supports local environment setup scripts and project actions through `.codex` configuration.

Rambla creates worktrees under `$RAMBLA_HOME/worktrees`, runs setup and teardown hooks from `rambla.json`, and gives each worktree its own dev server URLs like `web.fix-auth.my-app.localhost` so parallel services don't fight for ports.

## GitHub and review

Both tools support reviewing diffs, committing, pushing, and opening pull requests from the app.

Rambla also surfaces PR checks and reviews in the app, and exposes the same workflow through the CLI and MCP server.

## CLI and automation

Codex has its own CLI, IDE extension, web app, automations, and SDK.

Rambla's CLI controls the same daemon as the app:

```bash
rambla run --provider codex "implement OAuth"
rambla run --provider claude --worktree refactor-auth "refactor auth"
rambla run --host devbox:6767 "run the test suite"
rambla ls
rambla send <agent-id> "add tests"
rambla schedule create --cron "0 9 * * 1" "audit the codebase"
```

`rambla run --host` connects to a remote daemon. `rambla schedule` runs an agent on a cron. The MCP server lets other agents create worktrees, launch agents, open terminals, and send prompts.

## Voice

Codex App supports voice dictation.

Rambla supports dictation and realtime voice mode. Speech-to-text and text-to-speech can run locally on your device.
